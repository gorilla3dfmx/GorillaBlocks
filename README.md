## ‚ú® Key Features

This project serves as an excellent demonstration of Gorilla3D's capabilities, utilizing several advanced rendering techniques:

* **Bloom Effect:** Adds a vibrant, soft glow to the game elements, enhancing the visual fidelity.
* **Different Materials:** Showcases various material properties for diverse block appearances.
* **Shader Coding:** Custom shaders are implemented to achieve unique visual effects.
* **Mesh Instancing:** Optimizes rendering performance by drawing multiple identical blocks with a single draw call.

## üöÄ Performance Recommendation

Given the use of 3D rendering, mesh instancing, and post-processing effects like Bloom, **medium hardware performance** is recommended for the best experience.

| Component | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CPU** | Dual-core processor @ 2.0 GHz or higher |
| **RAM** | 4 GB or more |
| **GPU** | Dedicated or modern integrated graphics with support for **OpenGL 4.3+** or **OpenGLES 3.1** on Android |
